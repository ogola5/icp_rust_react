# agrisurance_dao

Welcome to your new agrisurance_dao project and to the internet computer development community. By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory.

To get started, you might want to explore the project directory structure and the default configuration file. Working with this project in your development environment will not affect any production deployment or identity tokens.

To learn more before you start working with agrisurance_dao, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Rust Canister Development Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/rust/)
- [ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk)
- [ic-cdk-macros](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk-macros)
- [Candid Introduction](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/candid/)

If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd agrisurance_dao/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background
npm run gen-deploy




If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```
.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
yarn start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

# Comprehensive Overview of the Agricultural Insurance and Governance Platform on ICP

This platform harnesses the power of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) to offer a groundbreaking solution in agricultural insurance and governance. It not only democratizes the management of agricultural risks and governance but also ensures transparency, security, and efficiency through a decentralized approach. Below is a detailed exploration of each core functionality and its impact on the ecosystem.

## Core Functionalities

### User Profiles Management

- **Functionality**: Users can create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) profiles, capturing essential information such as ID, name, role (Farmer or Consumer), transaction history, and DAO stake.
- **Impact**: Enhances transparency by providing a reliable reference for all ecosystem interactions, ensuring each user's actions are traceable and accountable.

### Transaction Management

- **Functionality**: Securely records every transaction, detailing amounts, dates, and involved parties. Offers CRUD operations to manage these records efficiently.
- **Impact**: Facilitates smooth financial operations within the ecosystem and contributes to a transparent audit trail, essential for trust and accountability.

### Insurance Contracts

- **Functionality**: Allows for the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of insurance contracts that detail terms, conditions, and payout criteria.
- **Impact**: Provides security and stability to the agricultural sector by ensuring that farmers and consumers are protected against unforeseen circumstances.

### Governance Proposals

- **Functionality**: Users can propose changes or new features to the platform, including proposal creation, reading, updating, and voting.
- **Impact**: Empowers users with a voice in the platform's evolution, ensuring it remains aligned with the community's needs and expectations.

### Stake Adjustments

- **Functionality**: Reflects adjustments in users' stakes within the DAO, based on predefined criteria such as DAO participation levels or transaction outcomes.
- **Impact**: Keeps the DAO's financial structure responsive and equitable, adjusting for contributions, participations, and other significant activities.

### Insurance Claims Processing

- **Functionality**: Facilitates the submission, verification, approval, or rejection of insurance claims, streamlining the entire process from claim initiation to resolution.
- **Impact**: Streamlines the claims process, ensuring it is fair, efficient, and responsive to the farmers' needs.

### Dispute Resolution

- **Functionality**: Manages disputes within the ecosystem, providing mechanisms for creating, updating, and resolving disputes, including the recording of dispute history.
- **Impact**: Ensures that conflicts are resolved in a transparent, fair, and efficient manner, maintaining harmony and trust within the ecosystem.

## Technical Implementation Details

The platform's robust backend is built in Rust, leveraging the power of the ICP for decentralized data storage and logic execution. The frontend, developed with React, provides an intuitive and responsive user experience, facilitating interaction with the blockchain backend.

### Rust Backend

- Utilizes advanced programming concepts and the `candid` interface description to create a secure and efficient backend.
- Employs `ic_stable_structures` for data persistence, ensuring data integrity across upgrades and state changes.

### React Frontend

- Offers a dynamic interface for interacting with the backend services, enabling users to manage their profiles, contracts, proposals, and more in real-time.
- Utilizes `@dfinity/agent` for seamless communication with the Internet Computer, ensuring actions are securely recorded on the blockchain.
